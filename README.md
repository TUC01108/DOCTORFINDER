<h1>This is DoctorFinder</h1>
<p>
DoctorFinder is an app where you can sign in as a Patient to book an appointment, check your bills, update your profile, and search doctors by name or specialty. You can also sign in as a Doctor and view all patients assigned to you, view all pending appointments as well as reject any that you do not want to accept, create bills for patients, and update your profile. This app’s backend is built in Spring Boot using Java, Hibernate, Tomcat, and connects to our database in PostgreSQL via the driver dependency. We connect to our frontend built in Angular utilizing components, models, services to create a fully functioning application thats entirely customizable.
